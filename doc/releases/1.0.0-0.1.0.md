This release is a prerelease of the software. It should not be used in production.

The `tec` module is at the point where I want to merge the `refactor` branch back into `master` and issue a prerelease. It is clear that the code in `refactor` isn't ready for prime time, but I really want the github issue tracker to stop displaying all those issues I've already closed.

The code has been significantly refactored. The main changes are:

* The module has a more pythonic API -- the main classes are no longer mirroring the behavior of `dict`s. Attributes are accessed according to the typical python syntax.
* The `astropy` package has been integrated into all parts of the module. Speficially, `astropy.units.Quantity` objects are used for data that has units, and `astropy.constants` are used instead of the cut-and-paste approach that was being used before.
