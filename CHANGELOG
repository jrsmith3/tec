Refactor Langmuir model, improve I/O

This release features a complete refactor of the
`tec.models.langmuir.Langmiur` class. The class has been refactored to
be more pythonic and to echo the API of the
`tec.electrode.metal.Metal` class.

Additionally, the I/O of the main classes have begun to be improved.
It is now possible to coerce objects of type
`tec.electrode.metal.Metal` (and its children) to dicts as well as
coercing objects of type `tec.TECBase` (and its children) to dicts.
Both of these main classes (and their children) can be serialized to
JSON.

Since this is a prerelease, some of the functionality is not robust --
the serialization functionality in particular.

Switch to PEP 440 for versioning

This project was using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) as its
versioning scheme. PEP 440 is more appropriate since the code is
written in python.
