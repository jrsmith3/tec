# tec - Utils for simulating thermoelectron energy conversion devices
A
[thermoelectron energy conversion device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermionic_converter)
(TEC) is a vacuum or vapor device that converts heat directly to
electrical work and is based on the phenomenon of
[thermoelectron emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermionic_emission)
(often called _thermionic_ emission). This package includes utilities
for simulating the performance of TECs.
